# Directing customers to subscription products through app behaviour analysis.

In todays market, companies have apps that are free but also provide paid versions of the app which have additional features. An example of this is YouTube Red. Since marketing is always costly to companies, it will be beneficial to know exactly who to target with offer and promotions.

Market: The target audience is customers who use a company's free product. In this case study, this refers to users who downloaded (and used) the free app.

Product: The pad memberships often provide enhanced versions of the free products alrady given for free, alongside new features. For example, YouTube Red allows you to leave the app while the audio from the video is still playing.

Goal: The aim of the model is to predict which users will not subscribe to the paid membership, so that greater marketing efforts can go into trying to convert them to be paid users. This selection of people can be referred to as the 'persuadables'.
